# Day 9: Blind Auction Project 💰🕶️

Welcome to **Day 9** of my #100DaysOfCode journey!  
Today, I built a **Blind Auction** program using Python — a fun project that simulates a silent bidding war between participants in the terminal.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Blind Auction** allows multiple users to enter bids without seeing each other’s offers.  
After all bids are entered, the program reveals the highest bidder and the winning amount.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to store and manage data using **Python dictionaries**
- Creating **reusable functions** to structure code
- Using **loops and conditionals** to control program flow
- Clearing the console screen to simulate "blind" input
- Enhancing user experience in a CLI-based app

---

## 🎯 Features

- Accepts bids from multiple users
- Keeps each bid hidden from others
- Determines and displays the **highest bidder**
- Option to continue or end bidding after each input
- Cross-platform screen clearing using the `os` module

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Modules used**:
  - `os` (for clearing screen)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python blind_auction.py
