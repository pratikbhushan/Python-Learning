# Day 10: Calculator Project 🔢🧮

Welcome to **Day 10** of my #100DaysOfCode journey!  
Today’s project was to build a **simple calculator** using Python — a console-based application that can perform continuous calculations and handle basic arithmetic operations.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This calculator allows users to perform:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)

The twist? After one calculation, the user can choose to continue calculating with the result — like a real calculator!

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating **reusable functions** for different operations
- Using **dictionaries to map operations to functions**
- Applying **recursion and loops** to control repeated calculations
- Handling user input and managing session flow
- Clearing the console screen for a smooth UX using the `os` module

---

## 🎯 Features

- Supports 4 basic arithmetic operations
- Allows continuous calculations without restarting the program
- Clears screen after each session for a clean interface
- Uses ASCII art logo for a visual touch

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Modules Used**:
  - `os` (for clearing terminal screen)
  - `art` or custom ASCII for logo (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the terminal:

```bash
python calculator.py
