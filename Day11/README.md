# 🃏 Day 11: Blackjack Game (21) - Python Project

Today’s challenge was to build a *command-line Blackjack (21) game* using Python. This classic card game pits the player against the computer (dealer) in a battle of luck and logic!

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This Python program mimics the popular *Blackjack card game*:
- You vs. the Computer (Dealer)
- Try to get as close to 21 without going over
- Aces can count as 1 or 11
- Face cards are worth 10
- Dealer draws until they reach 17 or more

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. You start with 2 random cards.
2. The dealer (computer) also gets 2 cards — but one is hidden.
3. You can choose to:
   - *Hit* (draw another card)
   - *Stand* (end your turn)
4. Dealer then plays their turn based on game rules.
5. The winner is decided based on who is closest to 21 without busting!

## 💡 Key Features

- Automatic Ace handling (1 or 11)
- Dynamic card dealing using random module
- Game restarts with each round
- Clean and readable UI in the terminal
- Logical winner determination
- Simple scoring system

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to simulate a card deck using lists
- Conditional logic for comparing scores
- Handling edge cases (like Blackjack and busts)
- Structuring procedural game logic
- Using functions to organize game flow
- List operations, loops, and randomness

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- *Language*: Python 3.x  
- *Modules Used*:
  - random – for card shuffling
