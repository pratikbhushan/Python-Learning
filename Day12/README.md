# 🎯 Day 12: Guess The Number - Python Project

Welcome to **Day 12** of my #100DaysOfCode journey!  
Today’s challenge was to build a **Guess The Number** game in Python — a fun and interactive console game where the player tries to guess the number the computer is thinking of!

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.  
Your job? **Guess it in as few attempts as possible!**  

You can choose a **difficulty level**:
- **Easy Mode**: 10 attempts
- **Hard Mode**: 5 attempts

After each guess, the game tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low** until you either guess correctly or run out of attempts.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Random number generation with the `random` module
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Helpful hints after each guess
- Win or lose messages with the correct number revealed
- Replay option to play multiple rounds

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using functions to organize game logic
- Implementing difficulty modes with different attempt counts
- Looping until win/lose conditions are met
- Using `if/elif/else` conditionals effectively
- Enhancing user interaction in the console

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Modules Used**:
  - `random` – for generating the secret number

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the game with:

```bash
python Guess The Number.py
