# Day 7 – Hangman Game 🎯

This is my Python implementation of the classic **Hangman** game, built as part of [Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## 🧠 What I learned
- Using `while` loops for game logic
- Working with Python lists and string manipulation
- Handling user input and validating guesses
- Organizing code into multiple files

## 📂 Files
- `hangman.py`: Main game logic
- `hangman_art.py`: Stores ASCII art for the hangman visuals
- `hangman_words.py`: Contains the list of words for the game

## ▶️ How to run
Run `hangman.py` in your terminal:
```bash
python hangman.py
